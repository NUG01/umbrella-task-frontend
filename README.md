### Getting Started

1\. First of all you need to clone 'umbrella-task-frontend' repository from github:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/NUG01/umbrella-task-frontend.git
```

2\.

```sh
npm install
```

3\. This step should have been copying .env file, but in that case I will provide it

##### Now, you should be good to go with!

```sh
  npm run dev

```

##### Open on localhost!
